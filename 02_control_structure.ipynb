    "\n",
    "## What is a conditional statement?\n",
    "A conditional statement controls whether a block code runs based on whether a condition is True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "## if:\n",
    "Runs code if conditon is true/ only runs code if the condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "## elif:\n",
    "checks additional conditions if the previous if is false. If indicator \"a\" does this; however check if indicator \"b\"  is also doing similar, then a stronger buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## else:\n",
    "Runs code if no conditions are True that is to say checks elif\n",
    "\n",
    "## purpose:\n",
    "makes decisions in code by chosing which path to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If conditions are not met, code cannot run. What we use when creating  bots i.e if volume is greater than $1000:  buy, if les tha $1000: sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user crosses this, do this: if market cap is greater than this, do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use it to build in logic as well. We can use it as well to create conditions in our code i.e if transaction amount is >$1m: print this...\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be used to create crypto tracking  bots or crypto trackers or you can use it to do a number of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify i.e if this transaction is  below this,term this person as this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are  very useful in our code for example if token A does this: buy token A elif if token  B does the same: then hold, however else dont trade or else buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How conditions work\n",
    "1 if: checks a condition-if True, runs the code.\n",
    "2 elif: short for else if: checks another condition if the first one is False\n",
    "3 else: runs if all the above con ditions were false.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If statement\n",
